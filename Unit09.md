**Unit 9: The European Union** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, we will look at the evolution of the European Union (EU),
an example of “transnational community formation” according to Professor
Haas, the father of neo-functionalism. This newly formed community
transcends the nation-state, and provides a model for areas of the world
where nation-states are failing. This unit will also introduce the
theories of Functionalism and Neo-Functionalism as they relate to the
formation of the EU, and explain the EU’s institutional structure.
Lastly, we will analyze the EU’s influence on international security and
defense policy.*

     Instructions: Read the webpage linked above. The EU has 3+1
    institutions, with very similar names. The European Council is an
    advisory body made up of all of the leaders of the EU member states;
    they set general direction and policy priorities. The European
    Parliament is elected by, and represents, the citizens of each EU
    member state; they pass laws, oversee the Commission, and monitor
    spending. The Council of the European Union is made up of ministers
    from each EU member state, and the council represents the states;
    they too pass laws, approve the budget, sign agreements with other
    countries, and coordinate the economic, foreign and defense
    policies, and judicial functions of EU member states. And finally,
    the European Commission, which is divided into departments, runs the
    day-to-day bureaucracy of the EU. Keep in mind that these are not
    all of the EU institutions; if you want to learn more, please view
    the left hand column for additional institutions.
